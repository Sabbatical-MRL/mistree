# MiSTree

This is the public repository for MiSTree, a python package for constructing and
analysing minimum spanning trees.

## Basic setup

To use MiSTree you must first download or clone this repository and then run:

`python setup.py`

This will compile a set of fortran files. Assuming they have compiled correctly
(it will tell you) you can then add the directory to your python paths. You should
now be able to import the module:

`import mistree as mist`

## Further details

In depth documentation and tutorials are provided [here](https://knaidoo29.github.io/mistree/).
